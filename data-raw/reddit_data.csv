More video of this from livestream. At 2:14:19. They try to light the pile of equipment on fire but fail multiple times. Jokes ask if anyone has a firebomb. After failing to burn the equipment they quip ""Oh actually, this bag is pretty nice so I think I'm gonna take that"" and then others begin to pick through the pile for what they can steal. 

Finally someone comes over to point out that it is actually Associated Press equipment and not CNN's ""I understand we're mad and all but I get it, *laughter* but we should probably make sure it's CNN first and that. *laughter* Well hopefully they have insurance. *laughter*""

Particularly stood out to me as its a perfect 5 minute encapsulation of everything that these exact people demonized BLM riots for, (looting, burning, misplaced aggression, property damage and validity of insurance as justification)

Here are about 10 videos with alternate views of that exact same location, including rioters passing broken chair and table legs out the window. I'll edit this post with a timestamp showing that exact scene in a few minutes when I can find it.

Edit: @0:40 a chair leg with a big nail sticking out of it is passed out the window. @1:09 a whole chair comes out.

I think it looks like the same window as the one in the video you mentioned, or at least an adjacent window. If you watch the whole series of videos on this YouTube channel, there's all kinds of crap behind thrown at, and used to bludgeon, the cops. It's all moving throughout the crowd.

As for the description in that Facebook link in French, it's disingenuous. The crowd has everything from people screaming, ""*this is not a peaceful protest, it's a revolution!*"" to ""*Stop! This is why we're called animals!*"" to ""*fuck the police! Fuck the FBI Hang him up!*"" to ""*don't hurt the cop!

President Trump also directed the [killing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-killing-qasem-soleimani/) of Iranian terrorist mastermind Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 2, 2020. The United States is a net natural gas exporter for the first time since 1957. President Trump imposed strict restrictions on travel from China on January 31, 2020, long before other leaders recognized the danger of this coronavirus. Then, when the COVID-19 virus began to spread rapidly within the United States, the dominant media narrative was a fear that we would run out of hospital beds to care for the sick. President Trump immediately [mobilized](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/491184-trump-says-1000-additional-military-personnel-to-deploy-to-ny) the military to construct huge new hospital facilities in New York City and elsewhere, and soon there were enough beds. The next fear was that we would run out of ventilators. President Trump [persuaded](https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-cheers-americas-production-of-ventilators-sending-them-to-other-countries-hit-hard-by) leaders of American industry to fast-track the manufacture of ventilators, and soon there were enough ventilators. Then the question was how soon to reopen buildings and meeting places, and President Trump wisely left the decision to local governors and other local officials who best know the different situations in their individual locations. In addition, President Trump, working with Congress, quickly passed [three](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-coronavirus-relief-bill-paycheck-protection-program-small-business-loans/) coronavirus relief packages, with the [result](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/whats-in-stimulus-package-coronavirus-149282) that millions of Americans continued to receive pay in spite of their workplaces being temporarily closed. A vaccine has been made in a process of 10 months, a lot shorter than it was tracked to be made, and is currently being distributed around the U.S. He signed the [First Step Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-championed-reforms-providing-hope-forgotten-americans/) on December 21, 2018. This law gives judges [more flexibility](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-championed-reforms-providing-hope-forgotten-americans/) in reducing mandatory sentencing guidelines in individual cases, eliminates the “three strikes” requirement of life imprisonment for some offenses, improves opportunities for academic and vocational education within prisons, provides more support for the successful reentry of released prisoners into society, and requires prisoners to be placed in prisons near their place of primary residence where possible (Joe Biden pushed the Crime Bill which increased incarceration rates to continued to climb for an additional 14 years. Incarcerating thousands and thousands of people from the Black community.) He [increased funds for HBCU's](https://www.breitbart.com/education/2019/09/12/fact-check-trump-increased-funds-for-black-colleges-17/) 17%. The process has begun to make the Space Force the 6th branch of the Armed Forces. Confirmed more circuit court judges than any other new administration. Reached a breakthrough agreement with the E.U. to increase U.S. exports. Had even lower deportation numbers than when Obama was in office. Workers began building the [wall](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-wall-200-mile-mark-southern-border), for better protection and less illegal immigration inside the country, so the levels of crime and drug trespassing lower more.

That he made bad decisions after the election day? Yes. I can simply understand that, and a lot of people can. But the problem is that core political and controversial people who only want to bring more problems say that ALL Trump supporters are equal, being a person who supports Trump doesn't mean being a HillBilly brainwashed person, being a person who supports Trump doesn't mean that I'm close-minded and can't think for myself, for a reason I'm accepting that all of this was stupid. I can also say that Trump did lots of bad things in these 4 years, and he has said things that he doesn't need to say. But the problem of all of your kind, and also the HillBilly's, is that ya'll generalize so much and see something on CNN or Fox and think everyone who supports that person is like that. I can assure you that 95%+ of the people who support Trump aren't necessarily like those people who stormed the Capitol and that 95%+ of the Biden supporters aren't rioters and stealers from BLM or Antifa who make the name of BLM look bad. Actually, I'm pretty sure that most of the people who voted for Biden and Trump are normal people who have a simple job and go to the voting chamber, vote, and then leave, they continue with their lives, that's how must of us are gonna do, Trump lost? Ok, I'll just continue with my life and that's it. Congrats to Joe Biden for winning. That I think he lies and other things? Sure I do. But guess what, if he makes something bad, I'll criticize him over that, and if he makes good things I'll congratulate him for that, good for America! Look, instead of judging people because of what you watched on CNN or Fox News, because yes, they both continue to [scratch](https://prnt.sc/wijz0r) the [sore](https://prnt.sc/wijzra) until something really bad happens. Because that's the part of the problem, News media, Twitter, and other social media that keep making all of this event even worse. You're another simple human who was wandering around a subreddit, me too. We should just get along, look at other's opinion, give our thoughts if needed, but there's no need for insulting, bullying, or other ways of making people feel bad because of some thought or decision, if Joe Biden does really bad in the next 4 years, do I have to insult you and tell you how bad you're because of a decision you made? No. You're another normal person, I'm sorry if I said anything at the start or any part of this text that directly made you feel bad, like an insult or something, I'm already too into this, and I have no time to read all of it. We should not fight each other. I hope you, all people who got to this point, and everyone else who ignored it a good day.

gihx097,anchoricex,"Consider uploading videos to skynet web portals at siasky.net not trying to be preachy but this is the most takedown resistant solution that comes to mind. Files are uploaded to and handed off to a decentralized network, 10x redundantly spread acrossed 10 different hosts meaning guaranteed retrieval. Network will replicate and fill file on replacement to hosts if any of those hosts fall off. Uploading to skynet is a free solution where web portals are currently bearing the cost and the caveat is a 90 day file fall off. Go to end of post for a permanent solution (costs $). 

The hash you get for your upload link can be used to retrieve the file from any web portal. Siasky.net and skyportal.xyz are some. 

If these domains get taken down for the web portals, you can spin up a full sia node (warning you’ll have to sync a 20gb blockchain) and use that hash in the node UI to retrieve the file yourself. You can also pin the file yourself on your own node and it won’t fall off skynet after 90 days and can keep using web portals to retrieve using the hash. 

For the ultimate perma solution you can upload directly to the network running a full sia node and form a contract with hosts and rent space from them and upload directly to the network without using a web portal, you define how long the files stay online with the contract you form. You can’t retrieve files from skynet web portals this way and This costs money but price is insanely cheap, however requires siacoin to form the contracts. I know the aversion to crypto currencies and not trying to shill, they are necessary to facilitate a trustless smartcontract between host and renter in this case. This method also has better redundancy and also uses reed solomon erasure encoding. Your files using this method will be split and encrypted into 30 pieces and spread acrossed 30 different hosts, any 10 of those pieces can be used to assemble the entirety of the file by the sia daemon. Network will self repair and find new hosts for any pieces of the file that go offline. 100% uptime and retrieval, impossible to take down.",1610101357.0,1610072557.0,1,1,0,0,False,1610073054.0,0,t1_gihx097,t3_krx449,/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/gihx097/

Once the mega link settles down in a few days, and I've synced up all of it, I'll create a torrent and push it out to the seedboxes, I'll then share it here for more people to join the swarm, once I feel that enough has landed on the seedboxes.  


After the whole archive is available on all the seedboxes, I'll spin up nginx on all of the once that I have full control over, and create some form of portal which will take you to the mirror closest to you geographically.   


If anyone knows if there's a place where people are discussing this operation, like an IRC channel or a discord server, let me know.  


Thanks to everyone who's helping out and submitting content. Y'all are amazing.

A little update! The mega hasn't been updated in over 24 hours, I'm going to create the ""final"" torrent today. I just finished deduping it (shaving ~78 gigabytes off the total size). Once I've created the torrent, I'm going to put it on at least a couple of my seedboxes before I send anyone else the link, so that  the torrent is healthy before you jump in to grab and seed it :)

I haven't been able to contact u/AdamLynch (which is very understandable as he probably has about a billion reddit messages and also a life :p) but I'll answer to this post in a similar manner by mentioning all of you once I've got the torrent up. 

When the torrent has propagated to all of my seedboxes I'm going to look into direct downloads

Thank you so much for your help!

The amount of military on either side is so low as to be irrelevant, not to mention it means nothing. I've worked with enough military to know that they're dreadfully representative of the population as a whole. 

Remember how BLM and Antifa were engaging in borderline open warfare with police last year?

Leftists have actually been doing that for the last few decades, and they've established a nationwide support and logistics network. Organized groups of medics, lawyers, protectors, documenters, etc travel to protests to support the effort of protesters.

The right has no experience with organized protesting against law enforcement, because until now, law enforcement has been on their side. They got their shit wrecked yesterday by so few police that Antifa would have passed them by because it'd be an unfair fight. 

My point isn't that one side is more or less ""tough"" really, just that one side has actually... You know... Done this before lol.

gif45mk,9bikes,"> you've got the ones taking selfies with the terrorists

I have not seen any selfies taken *by* the LEOs. I've seen selfies taken by trespassers inside the Capitol where the pic included him moving in close to the officer (and the officer didn't resist). I don't know why the officer didn't try to move out of the pic. Maybe the LEO was thinking ""let him incriminate himself"". Maybe it is their policy to allow all visitors to take photos with the cops. Maybe this officer was supportive on their movement.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that most of the Capitol Police officer s voted for Trump. I have worked with a lot of cops, and I know that they are generally a pretty conservative bunch. But they also tend to be people who are black and white thinkers; they have a line that once crossed the situation turns 180 degrees in their judgement. I'd *guess* that most cops voted for Trump, but draw a very firm line between peaceful protesters and rioters. (LOL, *I* obviously think that way too, to some extent!).

>it is a systemic problem

Again, you are absolutely correct. I sometimes get called a boot licker because I defend most LEOs and say that I have seen very few examples of any of them being ""a racist""; the problem is systemic.

gidtyhi,xienze,"> Are you really trying to minimize an attack on the capital building?

Who in that group attacked anyone?  You realize the only reason they had to ""smash their way in"" is because a building that normally is open to the public was locked down preemptively (along with the entire city), right?  Ironically, I kind of agree that the premature police escalation did actually make things worse in this instance.  But _despite all that_, no arson, no violence (except the young woman who was shot and killed by the capitol police).

And I assume you were likewise denouncing the actions of BLM protestors [who occupied the Tennessee state capitol building](https://fox17.com/news/local/nashville-protesters-enormous-progress-made-will-no-longer-occupy-capitol-plaza-247) for _62 days_, right?  Or is the national capitol the only one you care about?

Hey, what about these state capitol occupations?  All good because they were for the ""right"" reasons?

My only point was that your initial blanket statement, about all conservatives being scared of fireworks was just fucking bullshit. And there's no way you can deny that. Also, in your own words, it was ableist. Because you make fun of people for being scared of something. Which is a phobia and phobias can be considered disabilities.

Marxism doesn't have the slightest thing to do with anything I said. You're now trying to make this discussion political, which it isn't.

ginoq01,hachahacha,"Does anyone have video from the inside of the capitol as rioters (on both sides of the door) are being held back by 3 police officers?

I'm not talking about the well-known clash where one officer was being crushed. What I'm looking for is a video from inside the capitol building, where rioters who have already made their way inside are trying to convince the police to open the doors to let others in. The three police refuse, continue to hold the line. Rioters on the inside begin to push against the cops in unison. The doors break open. The cops continue to hold the line. One rioter can be heard saying something like, ""the police are still blocking them from coming in!"", as an alarm sounds and something like ""they're criminals - they're criminals - they're criminals"" can be heard on repeat, as if over an intercom. One rioter urges others not to hurt the police. Another says to the officer something like ""it's okay you're just doing your job"". Finally the rioters physically push their way through the officers and start funneling inside. 

Yesterday there was a long compilation video on youtube featuring this scene (at 9 minutes into the video). I believe the video was titled ""US Capitol Riots Compilation of"". It has since been removed. It had very few views at the time, and now I can't find it anywhere. And yes, I've been looking in the Mega file, but I may have missed it.

gih18e6,OmegaByte01,"No, I don't support Trump because of conspiracy theories, actually, I'm a Latino who has been supporting him for long enough, because right before all this COVID-19 thing happened, he had literally no competition that could get a victory as the President of the U.S., he had completed some things that I liked:

Almost 4 million jobs created since the election of 2016, the unemployment rate has been at its lowest in a long time. African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have hit its lowest rate ever recorded, Women's unemployment reached the lowest rate in 65 years, Youth unemployment hit the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, Unemployment of Americans without a High School diploma hit its lowest rate ever recorded, and veterans' unemployment reached its lowest rate in almost 20 years. He signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in history resulting in savings of $3,100 per household per year. After-tax cuts, over 300 billion dollars were poured back into the U.S. in the first quarter alone. On election day, 2016 (11-8-16), the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 18,332.74. Today, even during a pandemic, the economy has been able to sustain at a level where the Dow Jones Industrial Average is standing at 31,041.13**.** Secured $6 billion in NEW funding to fight the opioid epidemic. Increased coal exports by 60 percent and U.S. oil production reached an all-time high. He reversed the massive budget cuts that had seriously weakened our military under the Obama administration, President Trump has increased military spending by nearly $150 billion per year from $605 billion in 2016 to [$750 billion](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/1782623/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2020-budget-proposal/), steadily rebuilding U.S. military readiness. Reversing President Obama’s repeated marginalization and shunning of Israel, President Trump has reaffirmed our commitment to support and defend Israel. He decisively moved the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to [Jerusalem](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-officially-recognizes-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-orders-embassy-move-for-us). He recognized the [Golan Heights](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/trump-officially-recognized-israels-annexation-of-golan-heights.html) as part of Israel. He has welcomed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House several times and has repeatedly reaffirmed our support for Israel. I recently read in the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Israels-greatest-friend-sits-in-the-White-House-591063) a statement that Israel has never had a better friend in the White House than Donald Trump. On August 13, 2020, President Trump announced that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had come to a historic [agreement](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/13/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-agree-establish-diplomatic-ties/3364243001/) to establish full diplomatic relations between the two countries, including the establishment of permanent embassies and the beginning of direct airline flights between the two countries. This is important because Dubai, the largest city in the UAE, is the leading financial center in the Middle East and plays a paramount role in world air travel and tourism. The [agreement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-mideast-breakthrough-11597360774?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1) will “strengthen regional checks on Iranian power.” It also has the potential to set a pattern for future [agreements](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-mideast-breakthrough-11597360774?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1) establishing peaceful relations between Israel and other Arab countries in the Middle East. Also, he gave our military forces the freedom to [defeat ISIS](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/03/20/trump-says-isis-territory-in-syria-nearly-eliminated/) and drive them out of large sections of Iraq and Syria, which they did. This is far superior to the Democratic policy of inaction and appeasement, which had allowed ISIS to take over large areas of the Middle East. Under President Trump’s leadership, U.S. military forces located and [killed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-death-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi/) ISIS founder and terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Oct. 26-27, 2019.",1610085456.0,1610056656.0,3,3,0,0,False,False,9,t1_gih18e6,t1_gieh5pl,/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/gih18e6/

They were unprepared to use non-lethal force, so instead they focused on delaying the demonstrators while they got everyone to safe defensible locations. It is a good thing that only one person died, and that was at the hands of the secret service when she got too close to a sensitive area.

I don't think any protesters even came into contact with any of the employees of the building, because the police had done such a good job evacuating everyone. The protesters just wandered around the hallways for awhile engaging in light mischief, and then left.

giumpfg,booksearchplease,"John Sullivan / Jayden X just spent an hour providing really helpful director's commentary on his crimes that day.

His other videos should probably be saved too. I think at least one has but he may have posted more since then. The video quality is good. He was right there by the lady who was shot.

He's an enigma. Basically tries to identify as a journalist/documentarian in his capacity there, but he's clearly a participant. The weird thing is he has his own 'social justice' organization, but BLM or Antifa want nothing to do with him ([even prior to this](https://twitter.com/RebellionBaby/status/1331902008765206528)) and have suspected that he's an agent provocateur. I'm still trying to figure out his angle and motives, but I don't trust him at all. I definitely think he's an attention seeking brand builder and maybe just likes protests/riots but is flexible on the actual politics. I really can't stand him, though, after digging into him a bit.

Anyway he was questioned and let go, but seems to think that means he's out of the woods and won't be charged. So he sees no problem continuing to post content and confessions, which is hilarious. I hope he gets a knock at his door. He's way too confident and casual about the whole thing.

gij4vm5,I_LICK_CRUSTY_CLITS,">It's hilarious that you think I'm not leftist, because I am.

It's not important to the larger discussion, but how would you define a ""leftist""?

Here you said:

>you can't imagine someone on the left disagreeing with your anti-conservative bullshit

And I'm not sure you know the difference between ""someone on the left"", and a ""leftist"".

The entire premise of leftism is being ardently and fervently anti-conservative, because we see conservatism and its outcomes as an assault on human rights and the stifling of the human experience we all deserve to craft for ourselves.

To someone who is just ""on the left"", something as simple as ""billionaires should not exist"" might be ""anti-conservative"". 

To a leftist, ""anti-conservative"" is what we write on the side of our Kalashnikovs.

That's more hyperbole, in case you didn't notice, but actual Leftists would at least appreciate the sentiment of the joke. I doubt you will. 

>because American politics is so fucking polarized

""Polarized"" isn't inaccurate, just incomplete (or dishonest). The reason we're ""divided"" is because half the country pledges their fealty to a president that the left has been warning for YEARS would do EXACTLY FUCKING THIS if given the chance, and JUST BECAUSE WE OPPOSE HIM, the right believes we are actively destroying the country and their way of life. 

That's like saying ""terrorists and their victims are polarized"", because that's literally exactly what you're saying, because they are terrorists. Like. It's true, I guess, but maybe give a little more context so it's not 

>people are unable to look at anything objectively anymore.

There's no more need to look at anything objectively, the field has been set.

Americans vs domestic terrorists.

What subjectivity could there be, at this point? Debate about how much we should compromise with them...? 

We've been telling everyone this would happen, now it has, and people are still not willing to accept it. It's maddening. 

>My only point was that your initial blanket statement, about all conservatives being scared of fireworks was just fucking bullshit.

Your density would intimidate iridium. 

If I say ""Lasagna tastes good"", would you be like, ""OH YEAH, well one time when I was 6 I made a lasagna with LEAVES and DIRT! Why are you claiming that tastes good?!""

Hyperbole is a valid and incredibly useful form of communication because it allows us to have discussions without having to extraneously explain every detail of what we are saying. 

I was talking about conservative protesters, obviously, and how they react to explosives. 

Not that conservatives are literally all scared of fireworks weirdo, context is your friend. 

>Also, in your own words, it was ableist. Because you make fun of people for being scared of something. Which is a phobia and phobias can be considered disabilities

Again, you have absolutely NO FUCKIN CLUE what ableism is lol. You're making yourself look so very silly and I absolutely love it. 

>Marxism doesn't have the slightest thing to do with anything I said. You're now trying to make this discussion political, which it isn't.

No, lol. Are you actually real right now? 

CULTURAL Marxism. Any leftist activist, especially online, will have been called a Cultural Marxist at least a few times. It's a badge of honor, really. 

It's the boogeyman the modern right uses to object to things like, you know, inclusive language such as not using the word ""retard"" as an insult. The Nazis did literally the exact same thing, except they called it ""Cultural Bolshevism"", because the Nazi ideology never disappeared, it just adapted to the times. 

As for this discussion not being political, not only is that claim absurd in the face of it (the entire discussion is about political protesters...), but also, EVERY conversation is political. 

Politics is the system by which we determine our entire societal structure, which we then impose upon each other. 

Politics is everything. Everything is politics. 

>If you want an actual discussion about the thing that started all of this, your blanket statement of ALL conservatives being afraid of fireworks, please back your claim up with some data.

Right, so, I'm very disappointed in you for not using context clues to figure out that, very obviously, I was using hyperbole.

When I said ""conservatives"" in that context, I specifically and, again, very obviously, meant ""conservative protesters engaged in hostilities with opposing forces"" , police or otherwise really.

That's the basis of our disagreement, and it's all because you can't read real goodx

You also don't seem to realize that the reference to fireworks is, specially, a reference to a Portland protest, I think in August last year? where a shield wall of Antifa and a shield wall of radical right-wing terrorists were facing off, advancing towards each other.

The right wingers had already thrown at least two ACTUAL, HOMEMADE, NON-FIREWORK EXPLOSIVE DEVICES DESIGNED TO PRODUCE SHRAPNEL at Antifa earlier during the protest, and as they got close, an Antifa soldier threw a single mortar shell (as in, the firework) at the feet of the terrorists, and when it went off, the terrorists scattered and never recovered their position.

Meanwhile, Leftists have been eating police flashbangs and huffing their chemical weapons for over three decades, and at this point, we think it's cool and fun.

So, in conclusion:

Conservatives are scared of fireworks and can barely penetrate an unlocked building with the police waving them in, while Leftists chuck bombs at federal secret police because they like the aesthetic. 

>Otherwise get the fuck out of here with your political preaching.

Ah yes, just your standard leftist, advocating against educating, agitating, and organizing. 

>We support the same people, it's fucking unnecessary.

I can assure you that we do not.

gig7rpl,FellowHumanNeighbour,"""but oh God, dudes goofing off in the capitol, we’ve truly never know such horror in the country"" Yeah man. ""Goofing off in the capitol."" Storming the capitol, vandalising the capitol, stealing items from the capitol, 4 people getting killed in the process. This was a also superb opportunity for enemies of the country to plant tapes and other instruments inside the capitol. This puts the entire nation at risk. 

A statement like ""Goofing off in the capitol"" is such a ridiculous understatement of what took place that it actually makes me think that you're either a troll or you're still a young teenager that doesn't have the comprehesion to understand what is going on.

In case it's the latter, you got to seriously look at your own biases and evaluate your perspective on things. Imagine if Biden had lost the election and in turn Biden supporters stormed the capitol.
